At least from a broad perspective. You are also describing a lamp when saying &amp;ldquo;an illuminating device, generally composed of a stand and a bulb&amp;rdquo; The stand and the bulb are as much lamp as the object itself, but at the same time, completely different entities.
The whole world is built by these types of constructions.</description></item><item><title>On things #2 - On Greeks and Knowledge</title><link>https://ddesotto.com/posts/on-greeks-and-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 12:09:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ddesotto.com/posts/on-greeks-and-knowledge/</guid><description>Last week I finished reading Plato&amp;rsquo;s Republic. The week before, Rhetorics by Aristotle. Not so long ago, Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. A complete ancient greek reading spree, which I most certainly most regret (they have me backordered on Seneca&amp;rsquo;s Letters from a Stoic üò¢).

NFTs are a very risky asset. This is not financial advice NFT&amp;rsquo;s are a &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; now. At least for a growing group of believers. With daily sales of these assets approaching the $100 million mark and Beeple making headlines with his $69 million digital collage sale, interest for this new type of digital assets is spreading like an epidemic.

Now I&amp;rsquo;m here, which should be enough of a summary on how my WordPress experience went (spoiler alert, do not recommend).
My blog, bigdtalks.com, lasted one eternal year. While live, it hosted 15 posts with an average of 100 views/post, which is not bad, considering I had no prior experience. I built the site on Elementor (who calls that customizable?) and used BlueHost for buying the domain and hosting.</description></item></channel></rss>
