			<h1 id="why-ddesottoraw">Why ddesotto\raw</h1>
<p>I tried <strong>WordPress</strong>. Now I&rsquo;m here, which should be enough of a summary on how my <strong>WordPress</strong> experience went (spoiler alert, do not recommend).</p>
<p>My blog, <strong>bigdtalks.com</strong>, lasted one eternal year. While live, it hosted 15 posts with an average of 100 views/post, which is not bad, considering I had no prior experience. I built the site on Elementor (who calls that customizable?) and used BlueHost for buying the domain and hosting. Overall, the site came to a cost of around <strong>$160</strong>. You might be wondering how much the ROI was. Well, the answer is not that good.</p>
<p>At first I set up the site with the vision of having a possible source for passive income at the same time I shared my passion for acquiring knowledge. My idea was to use my already regular research sprees to then write articles on those topics. The perfect synergy. The problem is I became to focused on the former while forgetting the latter. A sidenote on building side-projects: <strong>focus on quality, and money will follow</strong>. Lesson learned üëç.</p>
<p>Having said that, those <strong>$160</strong> were probably the best investment I made in 2021 (and yes, I also bought <strong>ETH</strong> üòÉ). I have learned a lot from <strong>bigdtalks.com</strong>. I tried to reach perfection when, first, I didn&rsquo;t really know what perfection was, and second, I hadn&rsquo;t even tested if my idea was good enough. So for this blog, first publish, then ask. Good thing I can extrapolate it to practically any aspect of life. Thanks to my <em>&ldquo;failed&rdquo;</em> blog, I have now become more confident on making mistakes. I hope I learned the right lesson.</p>
<h1 id="why-github-pages--hugo">Why Github Pages + Hugo</h1>
<p>I have never been a Github groupie. Most of my projects went unnoticed to the general public, small scripts to automate basic tasks or to make use of a fancy algorithm I had learned about not so long ago. However, after I replaced <strong>IG</strong> and <strong>TikTok</strong> with <strong>Twitter</strong>, and having a small affection for HackerNews, where Github-related postings are a regular, hosting this website with GithubPages looked like an excellent way to make it both customizable <em>and</em> simple. Oh yes, and also very cheap üí∏.</p>
<p>I decided on Hugo over Jekyll inspired by a fellow blogger (if I can call myself that) I found on HackerNews, <strong>Kris Machowski</strong>. I really liked the simplicity and layout of his site and decided to use it as <em>&ldquo;inspiration&rdquo;</em>. By the way, his content is incredible, so please check it out <a href="https://machow.ski">here</a>. You won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>I have decided to set a list of objectives before a start as a way of setting waypoints to measure the success of this blog. Nothing complicated, but more of a test.</p>
<p><strong>For 2022</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>20 blog posts</li>
<li>100 newsletter subscribers</li>
<li>100 visitors</li>
<li>Building a useful relationship through the blog</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Featured on HackerNews Top5</li>
<li>Having revenue</li>
<li>Keep it running at least 5 years</li>
</ul>
