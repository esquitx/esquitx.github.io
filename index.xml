Now I&amp;rsquo;m here, which should be enough of a summary on how my WordPress experience went (spoiler alert, do not recommend).
My blog, bigdtalks.com, lasted one eternal year. While live, it hosted 15 posts with an average of 100 views/post, which is not bad, considering I had no prior experience. I built the site on Elementor (who calls that customizable?) and used BlueHost for buying the domain and hosting.</description></item></channel></rss>
